## Notes for original layout

Missing symbols are provided in its own library.

* Capacitors was picked as close as possible to what original has. Missing capacitor footprints was created from scratch
* Missing orignal resistors footprint was created from scratch
* Selenium rectifier was replaced with suitable 1N4004 and higher diode
* C8 10uF 200V replaced to one in modern case
